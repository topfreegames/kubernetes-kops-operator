                        from a combination of nodepool and pod scheduling constraints.

                                    TerminationGracePeriod is the maximum duration the controller will wait before forcefully deleting the pods on a node, measured from when deletion is first initiated.

                                    Warning: this feature takes precedence over a Pod's terminationGracePeriodSeconds value, and bypasses any blocked PDBs or the karpenter.sh/do-not-disrupt annotation.

                                    This field is intended to be used by cluster administrators to enforce that nodes can be cycled within a given time period.
                                    When set, drifted nodes will begin draining even if there are pods blocking eviction. Draining will respect PDBs and the do-not-disrupt annotation until the TGP is reached.

                                    Karpenter will preemptively delete pods so their terminationGracePeriodSeconds align with the node's terminationGracePeriod.
                                    If a pod would be terminated without being granted its full terminationGracePeriodSeconds prior to the node timeout,
                                    that pod will be deleted at T = node timeout - pod terminationGracePeriodSeconds.

                                    The feature can also be used to allow maximum time limits for long-running jobs which can delay node termination with preStop hooks.
                                    If left undefined, the controller will wait indefinitely for pods to be drained.

                            daemonsets to allow initialization and enforce startup ordering.  StartupTaints are ignored for provisioning
                            purposes in that pods are not required to tolerate a StartupTaint in order to have nodes provisioned for them.

                            "hairpin-veth":       set the hairpin flag on container veth interfaces.

                      description: |-
                        Severity provides an explicit classification of Reason code, so the users or machines can immediately
                        understand the current situation and act accordingly.
                        The Severity field MUST be set only when Status=False.

                        Many .condition.type values are consistent across resources like Available, but because arbitrary conditions
                        can be useful (see .node.status.conditions), the ability to deconflict is important.
